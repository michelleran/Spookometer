# Spookometer

Ghosts are everywhere… You just don’t know it.

Expose them with Spookometer! They might be invisible at first, but walk around and let the vibrations guide you towards their location. Once you’re close enough, they’ll appear!

Built using Unity's ARKit plugin, so meant for iOS. Some of the files are called "ARKitty" because I based this project off of a tutorial. Don't be fooled, though - these ghosts are definitely dogs!

Model provided by my sister, [Melissa](https://melissaran.itch.io/)!
